assignments
===========

Programs I've written for school.

I debated the ethics of posting solutions to assignments on line. I decided having my work available 
thwarts anyone who would blatantly try to pass it as their own. Also, I've gained insights in 
reading code written by others. I hope this helps someone.

The final decision came down to it being convenient to reference old work.
