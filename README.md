assignments
===========

Programs I've written for school.

I debated the ethics of posting solutions to assignments on line. I decided having my work available 
thwarts anyone who would blatantly try to pass it as their own. On the other hand, I've gained 
insights in reading others code.

The final decision came down to it being convenient for me to reference old work.
